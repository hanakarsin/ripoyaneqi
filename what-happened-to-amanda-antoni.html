"We, as a family, are speechless and still in shock at the unexplained death of our beloved Amanda," they said. They went on to describe her as goofy and fun-loving as well as stubborn at times. They then added, "We are also in search of answers, as we know many of you are as well."</p><p>Antoni's story is featured in Season 4 of <a href=#>Netflix</a>'s <a href=#>Unsolved Mysteries</a> reboot, which never fails to find the most fascinating stories. Hers is no exception. So, what happened to Amanda Antoni? We may not have an answer, but we have a good place to start.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Amanda Antoni</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Amanda Antoni?</h2><p>On Oct. 26, 2015, Amanda's husband Lee Antoni was returning home from a family trip when he was met with a horrifying scene. Amanda was lying on the floor of their basement, surrounded by her own blood. When Lee called the police, the only thing he could say to the first officer on the scene was, "She's in the basement." Like Lee, the officer was struck by the amount of blood. He believed she must have died from a head wound. What wasn't obvious was the cause of her injuries.</p><p>Once more officers arrived, one was instructed to sit with Lee, who was frantic and inconsolable. Based on the state of rigor mortis, experts believe Amanda died the day before her body was found. Other than an overturned dining room chair and Amanda's damaged cell phone lying next to it, police saw no signs that a break-in occurred. They concluded her death was not natural but were sure she did not take her own life. There were bruises all over her body, which pointed to a homicide.</p><p>In footage from the first officer's walk-through, he took note of a broken piggy bank by the basement stairs. Forensic experts later found pieces of it lodged in her skull as well as bloody fragments next to her body and on the stairs. It was only natural that the first person they looked to was Amanda's husband Lee.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Lee Antoni as seen in Netflix's 'Unsolved Mysteries'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Lee Antoni spoke out after Amanda's death.</h2><p>Lee told investigators that he and Amanda had never spent more than one night apart from each other, which seemed suspicious to police. They found it odd that the first time the couple was apart for an entire weekend, Amanda was met with a grizzly fate. Less than two months after Amanda died, Lee made his first statements to the media.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Global News</a>, he spoke about how lost he felt without Amanda. "All I really want is my wife back. I miss her every day, every minute, every second," he said while crying. "We are just lost for words, we just want closure."</p><p>As of the time of this writing, both Lee and Amanda's family are still looking for answers.</p><p>For more on this story, watch Unsolved Mysteries which will be available to stream on Netflix starting July 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSapZGjsaJ5wKerqKaZ</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-amanda-antoni.html&text=What%20Happened%20to%20Amanda%20Antoni%3f%20Her%20Family%20Seeks%20Answers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-amanda-antoni.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-amanda-antoni.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Amanda%20Antoni%3f%20Her%20Family%20Seeks%20Answers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-amanda-antoni.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Amanda%20Antoni%3f%20Her%20Family%20Seeks%20Answers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-amanda-antoni.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Amanda%20Antoni%3f%20Her%20Family%20Seeks%20Answers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-amanda-antoni.html&description=What%20Happened%20to%20Amanda%20Antoni%3f%20Her%20Family%20Seeks%20Answers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./does-tom-holland-have-a-tiktok.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Tom Holland Really Have a TikTok Account?
