Roberts, on Sunday released an amended list containing names of nominees for the national honour.</p><p>Against the previously leaked list which contained the names of 437 persons and was subsequently denied by the government, the new list contains 447 names.</p><p>It was observed that the name of former Senate President, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Bukola Saraki</strong>,</a> was not included in the amended list.</p><p>Another adjustment in the fresh list is the removal of the name of Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi for the conferment of the commander of the order of the Niger (CON) — an honour he had earlier received from the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan.</p><p>However, President Buhari in a statement obtained by <strong>Naija News</strong> shortly after the event begged the likes of Saraki, and Fayemi, among others not awarded with the national honour today, to be patient as their turn for the award will come soon and at the right time.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that Buhari also conferred the national honour on seven foreigners today.</p><p>It is worthy of note that 5,000 nominees were submitted to the awards committee earlier, but only 447 were selected for the awards.</p><p>Also, a total of 5,341 persons have been so far conferred with various National Honours since its inception in 1963. This includes the recipients of Tuesday awards.</p><p>President Buhari’s full speech read thus:&nbsp;​”It is my honour to address you on behalf of the Federal Government and the people of Nigeria on this occasion of the 2022 National Honours Award Investiture Ceremony.</p><p>“The Award of titles of honour, decorations and dignitaries is a solemn and patriotic event at which President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria honours deserving Nationals and Non-Nationals, who have distinguished themselves in the service of the nation and humanity in accordance with the National Honours Act CAP. N43 of the Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.</p><p>“The screening and selection of nominees for this year’s award as always, followed established broad criteria including but not limited to;</p><p>a. Consistent and meaningful participation in community and/or national development.<br>b. Rendering unsolicited, selfless and philanthropic services to humanity; outstanding sacrifice in the defence of a cause popularly adjudged to be positive, relevant and beneficial to the nation and community.<br>c. Distinct act of bravery in the protection and/or defence of national interest, public peace, safety of life and property.<br>d. Remarkable achievement in any field of expertise where the person’s activities in that field have made significant contributions to the attainment of national goals and objectives.<br>e. Immense contributions towards the upliftment of community, state, nation and/or humanity through achievements by way of inventions and bringing outstanding honour and glory to the state through personal dedication and patriotic commitment. Service with integrity is also a basis for the selection process.</p><p>“On this occasion, you may wish to recall that since the inception of this administration, there has not been such occasion like this where individuals and friends of Nigeria have been so singled out for investiture except for the Special Investiture Ceremony in honour of Chief MKO Abiola, Alhaji Baba Gana Kingibe and Chief Gani Fawehinmi, SAN whose ceremony was especially carried out to right the wrong done in the past, to assuage our feelings and to resolve to stand firm now and the future for the sanctity of the electoral process and our democracy.”</p><p>Buhari recalls in his address that he recently honoured some of the country’s athletes for their spectacular performances in several competitions.</p><h2>Nation Building Requires A Lot Of Sacrifices</h2><p>President Buhari said in his address that nation-building involves a lot of sacrifice by the citizenry.</p><p>According to him, citizens who contribute to national development deserve to be encouraged and appreciated. He said: “It is based on this premise that I reconstituted the National Honours Award Committee, Chaired by His Royal Highness, Justice Sidi Bage Muhammad I, JSC (Rtd), the Emir of Lafia, a distinguished retired Justice and other patriotic Nigerians as members to recommend suitable Nigerians and our friends for appropriate recognition.</p><p>“The committee has done a patriotic duty by diligently going through over 5,000 submissions and coming up with these recommendations.</p><p>“The patriotic Nigerians and our friends being honoured today, have distinguished themselves in various ways for the purpose of recreating a new Nigeria of our dreams through respect for the rule of law, image laundering, transparency and accountability in the management of scarce resources.</p><p>“Equally, those in the private sector have also creditably discharged themselves in business, entertainment, hospitality, transportation and other forms of human endeavours to transform Nigeria.</p><p>“We have amongst the recipients today, Amb. Prof. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Ms. Amina J. Mohammed and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who are doing our country proud on the international scene. Our dear sisters are a source of inspiration to our young women that through hard work and dedication, they can achieve greatness.</p><p>“We also have on the list, Imam Abdullahi Abubakar, a religious leader who hid over 262 Christians in his mosque from attacks in Yelwa Gindi Akwati village, in Plateau State. He is a good example of religious tolerance we preach amongst Nigerians. I am excited that he is being honoured today with Member of the Order of the Federal Republic (MFR).”</p><h2>Our Very Own Burna Boy</h2><p>Buhari hailed Nigerian entertainers who have repositioned the nation’s entertainment industry in the last few years. The President recognized the likes of Grammy Award winner, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Burna Boy</strong></a> and some top entertainers in the country.</p><p>According to him, their hard work has placed the nation on the global map.</p><p>He said: “Worthy of mention are our artists, particularly, our very own Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu (Burna Boy), who won the Grammy Awards in 2020. He along with other artistes have repositioned the Nigerian entertainment industry and placed it on the global map. At the just concluded Dubai Expo 2020, Nigeria’s pavilion was a beehive of activities as our musicians entertained guests from around the world.</p><p>“​Despite the present economic challenges, Nigeria still boasts of men and women of integrity; Ms. Josephine Agu, an airport cleaner returned $12,200 found in a toilet at Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos as well as Ogbanago Muhammed Ibrahim, a bank security man who found and returned $10,000. Today, we celebrate their dignity and strong strength of character by conferring National Honours on them. They are a shining example to our younger generation.</p><p>“I congratulate all the recipients today who will be joining the league of Awardees. I appreciate the non-Nigerian recipients and assure all of you that this administration will continue to provide the enabling environment for you to undertake your lawful businesses to allow you sustain your efforts at contributing to the development of our nation, Nigeria.”</p><p>According to the Nigerian leader, the National Honours are not merely decorative but also “remind us of an important part of our responsibility as citizens. We must always endeavour to do our best for our country. We will continue to root out all forms of banditry, criminality, terrorism and insurgency in the land. As I stated earlier in my Independence address to the nation, I will hand over a Nigeria that is free from insecurity to the next generation of leaders.”</p><p>Buhari also commended the Chairman and members of the<a href=# rel=noopener><strong> National Honours Award</strong> </a>Committee for a job well done.</p><p>The list of awardees according to him is justifiably long since this exercise has not been carried out since 2015.</p><p>He said: “Your commitment to the process of screening and selection has been well guided. ​Let me appeal to other Nigerians who are yet to receive this recognition to be patient and understand that their efforts in nation-building are appreciated and at the right time, will similarly be recognized.</p><p>“Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, this administration will continue to partner with Nigerians and friends of Nigeria with like minds in our efforts to build the Nigeria of our dream where everybody will thrive to excel in their chosen fields devoid of parochial sentiments.</p><p>“Thank you very much for your presence and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BqZp%2BtnKF6tLzEnpqhZaedrrV5wa6fmqqZYsCitcNmmJunpal6tK3RmqKiZZ%2Bptaa%2B0malqKxdmLyvssSrqZ6cXay2tbSMp5itoZ%2Bjrq15x6ilqK2iqHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffull-speech-what-buhari-said-about-saraki-others-not-conferred-with-national-honours.html&text=What%20Buhari%20Said%20About%20Saraki%2c%20Others%20Not%20Conferred%20With%20National%20Honours&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffull-speech-what-buhari-said-about-saraki-others-not-conferred-with-national-honours.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffull-speech-what-buhari-said-about-saraki-others-not-conferred-with-national-honours.html&title=What%20Buhari%20Said%20About%20Saraki%2c%20Others%20Not%20Conferred%20With%20National%20Honours" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffull-speech-what-buhari-said-about-saraki-others-not-conferred-with-national-honours.html&title=What%20Buhari%20Said%20About%20Saraki%2c%20Others%20Not%20Conferred%20With%20National%20Honours" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffull-speech-what-buhari-said-about-saraki-others-not-conferred-with-national-honours.html&title=What%20Buhari%20Said%20About%20Saraki%2c%20Others%20Not%20Conferred%20With%20National%20Honours" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffull-speech-what-buhari-said-about-saraki-others-not-conferred-with-national-honours.html&description=What%20Buhari%20Said%20About%20Saraki%2c%20Others%20Not%20Conferred%20With%20National%20Honours" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kacey-musgraves-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Kacey Musgraves Dating Now?
