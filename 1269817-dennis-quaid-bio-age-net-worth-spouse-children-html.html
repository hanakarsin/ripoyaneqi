His parents, Juanita Bonniedale, aka Jordan, and William Rudy Quaid were a real estate agent and an electrician respectively. Young Dennis Quaid was raised in the Baptist church and he attended Bellaire High School where he studied Mandarin and dance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9afeb30bd7809772.jpg><p class=align-left>After graduating high school, he enrolled at the University of Houston but dropped out before he could get his degree as he wanted to be an actor. After dropping out, he went to Los Angeles to join his older brother and pursue acting as a career. Despite this bold move, he always feared that he had made a mistake.</p>Everybody has fear and, of course, I was afraid things wouldn't work out. But I had an even greater fear of being stuck behind a desk my whole life, doing something I hate. So the greater fear won out, and that pushed me to at least try for what I wanted.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4880a3778b657987.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The fascinating story of John Krasinski: what is "The Office" star up to?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This fear and doubt propelled him in his first years in the acting industry. He had trouble finding work but despite this, he continued to put in the necessary time and work. He eventually got his big break in movies such as <i>Breaking Away</i> and <i>The Right Stuff</i>. These roles propelled him to become the great and legendary actor that we know today.</p><p class=align-left>Despite being in his sixties, the star is still a very handsome man. He has always been handsome. In 1987, Dennis Quaid young told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Washington Post</a> that while many considered him a heartthrob, he did not like the term. He felt as if that label would hinder his acting.</p><p class=align-left>The star enjoyed great roles and success in the 1980s but the 1990s were not very good to him. The actor developed an intense cocaine addiction. He would use 2 grams of the illegal substance a day. Thankfully, he eventually got himself into a rehab facility after he experienced a "white-light moment" where he saw himself lose everything he had and his life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d435e1a4d945333e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sam Worthington: Top facts about the amazing actor</span></p></a><h2>Dennis Quaid age</h2><p class=align-left>How old is Dennis Quaid?
