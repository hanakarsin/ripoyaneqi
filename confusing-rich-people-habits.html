I felt like I was literally getting taxed just for being there, having simply driven in my years-old <a href=#>Nissan</a> Altima to wait within a cul-de-sac of enormous houses, each of which could probably fit my own house inside them easily. One house had two garage doors in case you lost the first one and was guarded by two life-sized horse statues. The house that my brother was in was literally built like a castle, corner towers and all.</p><p>No matter how you shake it, the rich are built different. Whether they're buying up <a href=#>social media platforms</a> to run them into the ground, openly stating that they want <a href=#>writers</a> and <a href=#>actors</a> to lose their homes rather than let them receive fair wages, or building literal modern medieval castles as houses, their affluent lifestyles come off as entirely baffling to those of us who have ever had to pay bills in our lives.</p><p>One person on <a href=#>TikTok</a> had their own run-in with <a href=#>rich people</a> habits, and they all too baffled at what they saw.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@kyleefleekmakeup</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This vacationer breaks down confusing habits of rich people.</h2><p>In late July 2023, professional Māori makeup artist Kylee Fleek was flown from his New Zealand home to Sydney, Australia, courtesy of a collab between makeup brands Tarte and <a href=#>Sephora</a>. They even hooked him up with a luxurious business-class flight. From there, he took to his TikTok (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@kyleefleekmakeup</a>) to post about his experience, including all of the baffling rich-people habits that he encountered.</p><p>On his flight over, he received a hot towel which he'd never gotten on a flight before, and had to be told that it was meant to wipe his face with. What's more, he even had a tray on his flight specifically "for the champagne" that he was meant to receive.</p><p>Needless to say, he was all too baffled at some of the amenities that rich people likely take for granted. After all, how many of us have flown with a seat meant for champagne?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kyleefleekmakeup href=#>@kyleefleekmakeup</a><p>why do rich ppl live such a confusing life or like.. am i just stupid 💀</p><a title="♬ original sound - ✨ Kylee Fleek ✨" href=#>♬ original sound - ✨ Kylee Fleek ✨</a></figure><p>But it doesn't stop there. Tarte and Sephora hooked him up with an enormous hotel room that came with, among other luxuries, screens in the bathroom and a tub and shower separate from each other.</p><p>While he was ecstatic to be treated like a celebrity, he was also completely baffled at some of the accouterments that rich people are all too used to.</p><p>In one of his most popular viral TikToks, Kylee showed off his modest room-service order of tomato soup. Rather than come in a bowl, though, the soup itself came in a metal pitcher that you had to pour into a bowl full of garnish.</p><p>"It's just a bunch of little s--- that I don't get," Kylee admitted.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kyleefleekmakeup href=#>@kyleefleekmakeup</a><p>Replying to @🐺Miranda more rich ppl fancy pancy shit that shook me 💀</p><a title="♬ original sound - ✨ Kylee Fleek ✨" href=#>♬ original sound - ✨ Kylee Fleek ✨</a></figure><p>Of course, his stay was full of similar stories. In a follow-up, Kylee shared another instance on the same vacation in which a hotel worker came to his door and insisted that they open the door to present Kylee's room-service meal.</p><p>And by "present," Kylee explains that the worker gave him "a full course rundown of [his] meal."</p><p>Reportedly, Kylee had only ordered a burger at the time.</p><p>"I don't know if I could f------ live like that," Kylee admitted in his follow-up. "Like, being treated like you're above everyone else, like you're this magical figure that needs to be served. Like, f--- that."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@kyleefleekmakeup</a></figure><p>Folks in the comments section — i.e., normal people — are inclined to agree that rich folks have got to chill with their accommodations.</p><p>"Rich people have to constantly be treated like they're at a child's birthday party," one person complained.</p><p>Another TikToker wrote, "I'm too poor to understand this."</p><p>Now just imagine if rich people used an ounce of the wealth they've reserved for making every inch of their lives of luxury to, I don't know, pay us underprivileged folks?</p><p>But I guess if they did, we wouldn't have champagne cozies on our planes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLyvstSsoKefXae2pLSMqZyoqJyaeqmtwaKrrA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fconfusing-rich-people-habits.html&text=Man%20Breaks%20Down%20Confusing%20Rich-People%20Habits&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fconfusing-rich-people-habits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fconfusing-rich-people-habits.html&title=Man%20Breaks%20Down%20Confusing%20Rich-People%20Habits" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fconfusing-rich-people-habits.html&title=Man%20Breaks%20Down%20Confusing%20Rich-People%20Habits" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fconfusing-rich-people-habits.html&title=Man%20Breaks%20Down%20Confusing%20Rich-People%20Habits" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fconfusing-rich-people-habits.html&description=Man%20Breaks%20Down%20Confusing%20Rich-People%20Habits" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-does-janelle-from-sister-wives-live.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Does Janelle From Sister Wives Live?
