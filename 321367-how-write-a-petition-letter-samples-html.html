Each of the steps in this guide will help you to create a clear-cutting document to share with your colleagues. We have included examples of petitions that have worked to aid you to grasp the concept better.</p><h3>Legal petition format</h3><p class=align-left>Here is the structure to be followed:</p><h4>Header</h4><p class=align-left>You should include a capturing title, organization letterhead, your name, addresses, recipient name(s), date, Re or Sub, and salutation. Remember that this is a letter, so write the above information appropriately.</p><h4>Body</h4><p class=align-left>Follow the structure below:</p><ul><li><strong>First paragraph:</strong> Include the details of your petition.</li><li><strong>Second paragraph: </strong>Its outcomes, reasons, and so on.</li><li><strong>Third paragraph</strong>: Call for action.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bf5d7cc5e0d7c4d7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Minute writing: tips, examples and templates</span></p></a><h4>Closing</h4><p class=align-left>The conclusion part of the letter entails:</p><ul><li><strong>Subscription:</strong> You can use phrases such as thank you, best regards, yours sincerely, and so on.</li><li>Your signature.</li><li>First name and last name.</li><li><strong>Designation: </strong>If required, include this section.</li><li><strong>ENCL: </strong>Stands for an enclosure.</li></ul><h3>Procedure on how to write a petition</h3><p class=align-left>Below is the process you should follow when it comes to drafting impressive lobbies:</p><h4>Research your argument</h4><p class=align-left>Before you start a petition, make sure you develop your topic. Find out more details and literature about the case you want to present from various websites or ebooks. Get different ideas of not only what you want to be changed, but also what your counterparts might use to outdo you.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, if you are writing a lobby to the county government for maybe a new leisure park, then you should research rules and regulations regarding parks. Check if you can find your county’s previous budget and proposals for past leisure parks too.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9b4802e451c27a66.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best motivational speeches for students</span></p></a><h4>Know the jurisdiction for your case</h4><p class=align-left>Who will be implementing your lobby? Is it your workplace, school, a national organization, or just the local government? Contact them to make sure that they are the right authorities to address the petition.</p><p class=align-left>If it is a government office, then you should ask for guidelines on matters related to your case. Don’t forget to inquire whether the document will need approval after circulation.</p><h4>Find out how many valid signatures you might need</h4><p class=align-left>Many organizations and institutions have specific guidelines regarding the number of convincing signs you should have for it to be considered. You should confirm this with the relevant authorities. Also, make sure you know where you will submit your lobby.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to write a tribute to someone (with examples)</p><h4>Have a clear specific assertion for your goal(s)</h4><p class=align-left>Now you know what is required of you. Next, you should write a single statement that will frame all your objectives. The sentence should be precise, informative, as well as concise. It is not mandatory to include every point or target of your case. This statement will be your heading and should be bolded/put in the larger text so that it stands out. Here are some examples of petition titles that have healthy ideas:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs7tih4lv9sqn.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to write a resignation letter</span></p></a><ul><li>We demand a report on how the county allocation funds were used.</li><li>We call for commissioners to allot funds for a processing plant.</li></ul><p class=align-left>“We support more financing for a leisure park” is far much weak and very general. Instead, say, “We demand the local government to allocate more funds for a new leisure park in Kiambu Town.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d822555154126bb7.jpeg><h4>Write a brief cause summary</h4><p class=align-left>In line with your goals, include one or two paragraphs that will explain the nature of your issue. Mention why the issue matters to the audience in a way that will make sense to them even if they know nothing concerning it.</p><p class=align-left>Remember, the longer your lobby is, the less likely your audience will read it entirely and sign. Therefore, keep it short, just two to three paragraphs that can be scanned faster. You can choose to add a number list, which can help make your document easily readable.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3cqehs0idot.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to Download the Kenya Police Abstract Form on Demand</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Check your cause to make sure that it is eligible. You can have someone read it for clarity.</p><h4>Reference any sensitive information</h4><p class=align-left>Some people might want to know where you obtained information contained in the document to ascertain whether it is valid. For this reason, you have to prepare a new file that will cite all the references you referred to. These materials can be books or URLs. Don’t forget to include the date and time you accessed them.</p><h4>Proofread to make sure your petition is free from grammar and spelling errors</h4><p class=align-left>If you have a lot of mistakes in your lobby, the chances are that people might not take it seriously. So, use spell check programs and proofread manually for any errors. Loudly read it to determine whether it makes sense.</p><h4>Include a call to action</h4><p class=align-left>Your heading and succeeding paragraphs talk about what you want to be done about your issue. However, you should also add a brief statement of what will happen if your lobby is fulfilled. Explain the results you desire, be concise, and very specific.</p><p class=align-left>You can say, “We call the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Development to make sure at least 20% of all the buildings in the city are voucher-sponsored in the next three years.”</p><h4>Make people aware of what else they can do to make sure the cause succeeds</h4><p class=align-left>If desired, you can add a paragraph that highlights other things your audience can do to back your lobby. If calling meetings with politicians and authorities might help, then let people know how they can contact them.</p><p class=align-left>You can choose to say the following as you write a legal petition: “To further back up this idea, make an appointment with the Chief before the council’s voting day this coming month.”</p><h4>Draft a separate signing sheet</h4><p class=align-left>It is the actual action you want people to take, so don’t forget to include it. Make sure that you put the title of your petition on top of the file. Consider using a spreadsheet as it contains columns where the audience will include their name, sign, pho9ne number, zip code, and other vital details.</p><p class=align-left>Collect all the relevant information that will verify your signers are valid, alive, and live within the impacted area.</p><p class=align-left>Print excess copies than you need. It helps in reducing the waiting time as you collect signatures. It is considered better to be over-prepared than to turn away potential signers.</p><h4>Promote your petition</h4><p class=align-left>You should talk to the relevant audience in large numbers. Go to public spaces and expound the cause information to convince the audience. Collect their signatures and tell them to spread the word to their friends and family.</p><p class=align-left>If you want to talk to people on campuses, schools, property, or institutions, make sure you get permission from the relevant authorities. If there is any rally to take place in your area, ask for a chance to make a brief speech.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/850eb670bbe5d4ba.jpeg><p class=align-left>Always be polite when asking people to sign your petition. Use social media and the internet to your advantage. Spread the document through emails, WhatsApp groups, and so on. Try not to flood people with your posts as that might be a turnoff.</p><h2>Petition letter sample for complaint</h2><p class=align-left><i>We demand your roofing crew to reinstall the sub-standardly mounted shingles</i></p><p class=align-left><i>Engineer Kipkirui Dennis,</i></p><p class=align-left><i>Mabati Mpya enterprise,</i></p><p class=align-left><i>PO.
