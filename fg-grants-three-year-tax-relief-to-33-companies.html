were benefitting from the tax incentive scheme in Q1, while the requests of 132 companies were still pending.</p><p>As at March 31, 2021, the firms granted tax reliefs invested a total of N45.5bn in the Nigerian economy.</p><p>A cursory look at the second quarter PSI report for the year 2021 showed that the government granted tax holidays to eight firms who invested an aggregate of N12.8bn.</p><p>Seven firms got approval in principle while no application was denied in Q2, the NIPC said.</p><p>The report also revealed that 31 firms were benefitting from the tax incentive scheme, while the requests of 160 companies were still pending.</p><p>In the third quarter of last year, eight firms were granted PSI while the requests of two companies were rejected.</p><p>The firms offered tax holidays invested a whopping N328.5bn into the economy during the review period, the NIPC report said.</p><p>The NIPC also revealed that the government granted approval in principle to 16 firms, 168 applications were pending and 35 companies were benefitting from the government’s tax incentive in Q3.</p><p>Meanwhile, the latest PSI report from the NIPC revealed that in the last quarter of the year, six companies were granted tax reliefs for a three-year period.</p><p>The companies are First Independent Power Company, Cormart Nigeria Limited, Premium Agro Chemicals Limited, West African Soy Industries Limited, Prudent Energy and Services Limited, and Checkers Africa Limited.</p><p>These companies contributed N157.08bn to total investments in Q4 2021.</p><p>Further analysis of the Q4 report revealed that, during the period, 13 companies had their applications approved in principle while the application of one company was denied.</p><p>As at the end of 2021, 46 companies were
