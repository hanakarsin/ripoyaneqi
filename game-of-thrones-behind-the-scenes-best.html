It played during the show's regular time slot this past Sunday night and fans of the series are learning quite a bit about the show. Not just how it came together and the remarkable story behind how George R. R. Martin's brilliant fantasy series was finally brought from the page to the TV screen, but other interesting tidbits as well.</p><p>With all of the ire surrounding the show's much-maligned final season, however, what audiences were most taken with was how the cast reacted at the table read where they learned how showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss would wrap things up.</p><p>There were plenty of candid reaction shots from the major actors' as their characters' fates unfolded.</p><p>Some of the reactions, were less than ideal. I'm just saying, if I was a writer or a producer, I don't think I'd want any actor to react to my script the way that Conleth Hill, the man who plays Varys, did when he read how his beloved character would die.</p><p>Many said Conleth looked visibly angry and annoyed when he learned Varys was burned alive by Drogon after Daenerys branded him a traitor.</p><p>See for yourself:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>DUDE WHO PLAYS VARYS IS PISSED LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8QHY5CBWkE</a></p>— D&D can burn in hell (@Cindtrillella) <a href=#>May 27, 2019</a></figure><p>After reading his fate, Conleth tossed his script on the table and sat back in his chair, visibly upset at the fate of Varys. You can quickly see Lena Headey, who plays Cersei Lannister, give him a conciliatory pat, and Emilia Clarke looks in his direction looking almost guilty over her character issuing the death sentence. It's a tense moment that was captured on camera, but also memed all over social media.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Varys tossed that script like <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YP14VHT9sp</a></p>— Elijah Stewart (@EJ_Stewart) <a href=#>May 27, 2019</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>THIS IS HIM INSIDE <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kLk8ZKiyhG</a></p>— Bob (@AlmightyOma) <a href=#>May 27, 2019</a></figure><p>Many thought the way Varys put endangered himself and got caught by Daenerys was completely out of character for "The Spider." He's notoriously sly and is always several steps ahead of every other character in the show, which may be one of the biggest reasons Conleth was so upset at how he went out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Conleth isn't the only actor to have an emotional reaction to a seemingly out-of-nowhere plot twist during the final table read.</p><p>Actor Kit Harrington's reaction to Jon Snow stabbing Daenerys in the heart as he gives her an ultimate, passionate kiss also caught the attention of viewers.</p><p>In the clip below, Kit's visibly upset and moved to tears after finding out he's the one to kill Dany. It's an ending many disliked, especially considering that many believed Dany's turn as the "Mad Queen" was rushed.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DLLGaBBTIY</a></p>— 🌞 (@ikraaneyyyyy) <a href=#>May 27, 2019</a></figure><p>Of course, Kit's reaction got the meme treatment as well. It's safe to say a lot of fans had the same reaction when they learned about Daenerys' demise.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>poor Jon literally went full Costanza <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xrXl70ImRq</a></p>— 'Bron C. Reilly (@IamBigL) <a href=#>May 27, 2019</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>The documentary also answered fans' burning questions about some of the more ridiculous things that happened in the final season. Namely, how did Arya manage to get so much air time with the "ridiculous" jump that got her closer to the Night King?</p><p>Some fans thought it was the result of her training as a highly-trained assassin, but even the world's most acrobatic and prolific killers wouldn't be able to leap that high in the air. Game of Thrones might be set in a fantasy world, but human beings are just human beings at the end of the day, not kangaroo hybrids.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hbo</span></figure><p>The original screenplay called for Arya to jump off of a pile of slain wights. In the behind-the-scenes footage, producer Bryan Cogman reads the following action from the teleplay:</p><p>"She vaults off a pile of dead wights, leaps at the Night King, and she plunges the dagger up through the Night King’s armour. The Night King shatters."</p><p>Looks like the showrunners thought it'd be kind of weirdly convenient to have a pile of dead baddies positioned in the perfect spot for Arya to hop up and plunge a dagger into the Night King's chest. They must've only thought it was a bad idea in post-production, however, because the jump remained.</p><p>Are there any other things you learned from the documentary that surprised you?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnK6usYyonWasmKe8r7HSZpmeoJmjsW7Ax55krJuVo7K0ecGeqq0%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgame-of-thrones-behind-the-scenes-best.html&text=The%20Best%20Behind-The-Scenes%20Moments%20from%20the%20%27Game%20of%20Thrones%3a%20The%20Last%20Watch%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgame-of-thrones-behind-the-scenes-best.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgame-of-thrones-behind-the-scenes-best.html&title=The%20Best%20Behind-The-Scenes%20Moments%20from%20the%20%27Game%20of%20Thrones%3a%20The%20Last%20Watch%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgame-of-thrones-behind-the-scenes-best.html&title=The%20Best%20Behind-The-Scenes%20Moments%20from%20the%20%27Game%20of%20Thrones%3a%20The%20Last%20Watch%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgame-of-thrones-behind-the-scenes-best.html&title=The%20Best%20Behind-The-Scenes%20Moments%20from%20the%20%27Game%20of%20Thrones%3a%20The%20Last%20Watch%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgame-of-thrones-behind-the-scenes-best.html&description=The%20Best%20Behind-The-Scenes%20Moments%20from%20the%20%27Game%20of%20Thrones%3a%20The%20Last%20Watch%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./best-ufo-documentaries.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Best UFO Documentaries to Watch After 'Top Secret UFO Projects'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./my-daughter-just-became-a-server-in-a-restaurant.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mom Buys Box of Misprint Pens and the Results Are Hilarious">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
