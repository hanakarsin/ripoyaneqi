Anyway, if you’ve watched <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a>, you already know that Jason isn't afraid to cuddle up with his employees.</p><p>While the 5'6" king has never been married, he did previously date three of his current O Group agents — <a href=#>Chrishell Stause</a>, <a href=#>Nicole Young</a>, and <a href=#>Mary Bonnet (née Fitzgerald)</a> — and admits to having hooking up with another one. He also dated model <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie-Lou Nurk</a>, who was 20 years younger than him.</p><p>These relationships all ended but a catch like Jason doesn't stay single for that long.

Jason is 20 years older than Marie-Lou.</p><p>The model, who was born in Germany but now lives in Paris, made their relationship social media official in a Feb. 2, 2023 TikTok.

We remain close friends and continue to talk often and support each other and we want the very best for one another. We thank everyone for their support throughout our relationship."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Jason Oppenheim has dated three of his 'Selling Sunset' co-stars.</h2><p>Repeatedly throughout Selling Sunset, Jason has been characterized as this diligent career man who doesn't really have time for relationships or starting a family. That said, it may be why he ended up dating three of his employees, so he could mix business with pleasure. Or it could be the fact that literally everyone at the O Group is just really hot.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Jason Oppenheim and Chrishell Stause on an episode of 'Selling Sunset' Season 5.</p></figure><p>Jason dated Chrishell from July 2021 to December 2021. Their relationship was heavily featured on Selling Sunset Season 5 and many were quick to speculate that they were faking it for the camera. However, former O Group agent <a href=#>Maya Vander exclusively told Distractify</a> that they were "very happy together" and it was "not a PR stunt."</p><p>The reason behind their emotional breakup was that Chrishell wanted to be a mom, but fatherhood wasn't on Jason's vision board. <a href=#>Chrishell is currently married</a> to Australian musician <a href=#>G-Flip</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jason Oppenheim (@jasonoppenheim)</a></p></figure><p>Years before Selling Sunset started, Jason also went steady with Nicole and Mary. However, these relationships pre-date social media.</p><p style=text-align:start>Nicole, who joined the series during Season 6, revealed that she and Jason dated "13 or 14 years ago," and that she wasn't working as one of his agents at the time. However, they clearly ended on good terms as she went to work for the O Group few years later. Nicole is now married to husband <a href=#>Brandon Young</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty images</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty images</span></figure><p>Mary, who has been a member of the cast since the show's inception, also admitted to having a romantic relationship with the short king.</p><p>"Jason and I have been friends for probably 15 years. We dated for maybe a year of that," she once said during an episode.</p><p>During that time, they bought two dogs, which they continue to co-parent today. Mary is now happily married to her <a href=#>husband, Romain Bonnet</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Amanza Smith reveals she and Jason have previously hooked up.</h2><p>During the Selling Sunset Season 7 reunion episode, several members of the cast took a lie detector test. When Jason was asked if he had hooked up with anyone in the office besides Chrishell, Nicole, or Mary, he said no. But his co-stars knew that wasn't true and made a comottion about the polygraph being inaccurate.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: netflix</span></figure><p>"[Is this] because I made out Jason?" Amanza asked, aware that the machine had made a mistake. She claimed she and Jason became romantic at some point in their 23 year friendship. When asked if they did more than make out, she answered yes. This seems to be way in the past though as <a href=#>Amanza is currently dating David LaQua</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn660u81mpqmolaO1prXMZpuarJmjtA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjason-oppenheim-dating.html&text=A%20List%20of%20All%20His%20Exes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjason-oppenheim-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjason-oppenheim-dating.html&title=A%20List%20of%20All%20His%20Exes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjason-oppenheim-dating.html&title=A%20List%20of%20All%20His%20Exes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjason-oppenheim-dating.html&title=A%20List%20of%20All%20His%20Exes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjason-oppenheim-dating.html&description=A%20List%20of%20All%20His%20Exes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sss-security-law-experts-bicker-over-bawas-continuous-detention.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DSS, Security, Law Experts Bicker Over Bawa's Continuous Detention">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rap-game-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Rap Game - Cast, Ages, Trivia">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
