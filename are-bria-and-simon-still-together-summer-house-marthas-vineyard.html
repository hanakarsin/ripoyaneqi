She felt Simon was acting out by wearing an inflatable flamingo suit costume at Nick Arrington’s after-party for an event he held to honor his late friend and fraternity line brother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron Bivens</a>. As Simon paraded the suit around the house, Bria grabbed it off of him and told him, “You’re being trash as f--k.”</p><p>Simon, who appeared intoxicated, didn’t know why Bria was so upset, stating he was just “having a good time.” Bria didn’t offer him any sympathy and said he was “causing problems for me.”</p><p>“This relationship is over,” Bria told Simon. “Pack your s--t up and go.”</p><p>Bria told Simon that he didn’t put her feelings on the same “pedestal.” After their housemates saw them arguing, <a href=#>Amir Lancaster</a> drunkenly tried to intervene, but Bria appeared to be done.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>*bria & simon breaking up in their bedroom*</p><p>everyone else downstairs: <a href=#>#summerhousemv</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gJ54D4c4JJ</a></p>— jordy🦋 (@heirjordynn) <a href=#>May 6, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Bria decided her and Simon’s relationship was “worth salvaging.”</h2><p>The next day, in Season 2, Episode 8, Bria told her friends <a href=#>Shanice Henderson</a>, <a href=#>Noelle Hughley</a>, and Amir’s <a href=#>girlfriend Natalie Cortes</a> that she felt she and Simon needed “boundaries” put in place if their relationship stood a chance. In another scene, Simon and Bria discuss the many issues affecting them, including the fact they’re in an interracial relationship.</p><p>Bria opened up about having to endure racist remarks by many of Simon’s friends and family as a Black woman living in Germany. She then equated the flamingo suit with Simon not “listening” to her when she told him about the racist remarks.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>That wasn’t even a micro aggression, that was a MACRO aggression.

He then begged her to move forward, and she agreed to forgive him as long as he ensured she felt “secure” in the relationship.</p><p>“My relationship with Simon is worth salvaging,” Bria said. “He is always willing to give me a second chance even when I’m wrong and even when I’m going off for no reason.”</p><p>Simon and Bria hugged and decided to move forward.
