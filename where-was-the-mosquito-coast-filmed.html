A variety of locations are utilized in the show, but where was The Mosquito Coast actually filmed?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was 'The Mosquito Coast' filmed?</h2><p>When the series begins, Allie and his family are living in Southern California near the asparagus farm where the patriarch works. Those scenes were shot in Ventura County and, more specifically, in Piru and in the cities of Moorpark and Fillmore.&nbsp;</p><p>Once Allie, Margot, and their kids embark on their road trip, they're seen traveling in the greater Los Angeles area.</p><p>As they move toward the border, the setting shifts to Mexico.&nbsp;</p><p>The cast and crew had intended on filming in Mexico City as well, but production shut down there in March of 2020 due to the pandemic.</p><p>It resumed in October of that year, and it largely then took place in the Mexican states of Nayarit and Jalisco.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Apple TV+</span></figure><p>The scenes of the Fox family driving along the Pacific Ocean were mostly filmed on the Riviera Nayarit, which is a 200-mile coastline stretch.</p><p>Other episode moments were shot in towns just off the coast in Nayarit.</p><p>Some of the city shots were taken in Guadalajara and Zapopan, which are both in Jalisco. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 'The Mosquito Coast' renewed for Season 2?</h2><p>Though Allie's main goal is to get to the Mosquito Coast, he doesn't actually get there in the first season. It's been referred to as a "prequel" of sorts when compared to the plot of the book (though it takes place in the present, while the book was focused in the '80s).</p><p>This sets up the plot for a potential second season, but The Mosquito Coast hasn't been renewed for yet.</p><p>Star Justin Theroux told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> that he is interested in continuing the Apple TV+ series in the future, and that the first season only really scratched the surface on the Fox family's potential.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"The thing that I look forward to, and I hope we get to some version of, is him [Allie] finding the Shangri-La. The things I like most in the movie are when they have that essentially a sort of Robinson Crusoe-style living situation where you can walk out in the morning and pick a mango off a tree and there's lunch," he explained. "I do want them to have a respite at some point where they enjoy themselves and reconnect as a family.
