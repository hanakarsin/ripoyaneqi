The company was also to be paid upfront. Our investigation pointed to a conflict of interest.”</p><p>The leaked memo shows Amaechi in his presentation stated that the Bureau of Public Procurement had reviewed the process of procurement and had given a certificate of no objection for the contract, adding that the project would be funded from the N71.4bn budget of the ministry.</p><p>The minister subsequently asked the council to “approve the award of contract for the procurement and installation of electronic surveillance system and interrogation unit on the Abuja (Idu)-Kaduna (Rigasa) 200km railway monitoring rail intrusion detection system and emergency response system in favour of Messrs Mogjan Nigeria Limited/Cagewox Dot Net Limited in the sum of ₦3,780,827,410.66 inclusive of 7.5 per cent VAT with a completion period of four months.”</p><p>Ministers in the council questioned the capacity of the firm to deliver and also the failure of Amaechi to provide proper detail on the capabilities of the equipment.</p><p>The minutes of the meeting read in part, “Some members expressed concern about the quality of the memorandum as there was no description of the surveillance system concept note, brand name, country of manufacture or review by the previous user to enable them to make informed decisions.</p><p>“They stated that as sophisticated as the surveillance system was touted to be, there were no indications that it had been demonstrated and tested by the security technology agencies. They equally observed that all the projects were lumped together under one budget line, which they noted was not good enough as each rail line project was supposed to be captured in its individual budget line.”</p><p>According to the minutes of the FEC meeting, the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, asked if the equipment would be installed across all rail lines in the country and if there would be a provision for training to enable staff members to acquire knowledge and build capacity on the use of the surveillance system.</p><p>Osinbajo pointed out that the solution system was “described in a generic term and whether it had a brand name, adding that the system, being a rail equipment monitoring solution, ought to have a brand name and a comprehensive description of its functions.”</p><p>The Vice-President also needed a description of how the system would work.</p><p>Amaechi in his response to the questions said it is just a pilot programme and if it worked, it would be replicated across the country. He said the system would work in such a way that if the rail was tampered with, it would send signals to an observation platform.</p><p>The memo read, “In his remarks, the Vice-President directed that given the observation raised by members, there was a need for the ministry to provide a further description of the equipment, its brand name, manufacturer and how it worked.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e49qZqWdkaCypXnMnqSoq12nsrexwKVksKCpYrOmr4yrnKOdk6mypXnAppiem5iewG5xpGtccWpVdoN0eZabpWarlZjCs7XTsmSpqp%2BlvLSty2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fleaked-memos-reveal-why-fec-rejected-amaechis-e2-82-a63-7bn-security-proposal.html&text=Leaked%20Memos%20Reveal%20Why%20FEC%20Rejected%20Amaechis%203.7bn%20Security%20Proposal&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fleaked-memos-reveal-why-fec-rejected-amaechis-e2-82-a63-7bn-security-proposal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fleaked-memos-reveal-why-fec-rejected-amaechis-e2-82-a63-7bn-security-proposal.html&title=Leaked%20Memos%20Reveal%20Why%20FEC%20Rejected%20Amaechis%203.7bn%20Security%20Proposal" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fleaked-memos-reveal-why-fec-rejected-amaechis-e2-82-a63-7bn-security-proposal.html&title=Leaked%20Memos%20Reveal%20Why%20FEC%20Rejected%20Amaechis%203.7bn%20Security%20Proposal" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fleaked-memos-reveal-why-fec-rejected-amaechis-e2-82-a63-7bn-security-proposal.html&title=Leaked%20Memos%20Reveal%20Why%20FEC%20Rejected%20Amaechis%203.7bn%20Security%20Proposal" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fleaked-memos-reveal-why-fec-rejected-amaechis-e2-82-a63-7bn-security-proposal.html&description=Leaked%20Memos%20Reveal%20Why%20FEC%20Rejected%20Amaechis%203.7bn%20Security%20Proposal" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alex-casas-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="lex Casas - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hornet-womans-wedding-dress-during-vows.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hornet Flies Into Woman's Wedding Dress During Her Vows">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
