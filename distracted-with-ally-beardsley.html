While each of the Bad Kids has a bit of reputation, none are as wild as Kristen Applebees, played by comedian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ally Beardsley.</a></p><p>Following the conclusion of the third season of Fantasy High, Ally took some time to chat with Distractify and answer 13 quick questions, spilling on their dice superstitions and their favorite NPCs from the series.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">If you had to get a tattoo right now, what would it be?</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>Oh, that's a great question. I don't know. I've been like weirdly drawn to getting like a back tattoo like where people put like their last name across their back, just like all the men in my family have like our last name on their back and I'm like, That would be so funny, but I don't think I would actually get it. That's like a huge undertaking. But something there I feel the back is next.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">If you could have any superpower, what would you pick?</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>A healed attachment style.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Dropout</span></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What is your go-to karaoke song?</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>Right now, it's "You Oughta Know" by Alanis Morissette. For a while it was "God's Country" by Blake Shelton.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What are your top three game day necessities?</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>The last season Lou and I really got into buying a bottle of really nice bitters, like bartender bitters, and we would do seltzer and bitters. And it was just like a nice little break from just kind of the monotony of like chugging coffee and water all day. It was like so effervescent. So that's definitely an essential.</p><p>Coffee is also an essential. I like to hand grind my beans like an old-timey Ren Faire wench, and so I bring my grinder and that is actually pretty important, because I go out and I'm in the sun, and I'm like hand grinding these beans and it like smells so good. It's really meditative for me. There's something about the artificial lighting of being in the studio all day that can make you feel crazy and you have no idea what time it is. So it's really nice to go out and be like, ah, it is the middle of the day. The sun is out and I'm grinding my beans.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dimension 20 (@dimension20show)</a></p></figure><p>And gluten-free freezer waffles. Everyone makes fun of me because that's the first thing I go for the second I get into the studio. I don't know who's stocking those. They're just always in the freezer. They're in the share freezer, I will point that out. I'm not just like stealing someone's waffles the second I walk in, but I do crazy stuff with that. I put a little ham and cheddar on 'em. I'll go sweet. I'll go savory. Big fan.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Tell us about the first Dungeons & Dragons campaign you ever played.</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>It's called Fantasy High. And some people may have heard of it. But I actually had never played before Fantasy High. So my first campaign was filmed and put on the internet and still lives there.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">If you could switch lives with any celebrity for a day, who would it be?</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>Lisa Kudrow. I just think she's so funny and I'm dying to know what like her day to day life looks like.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">If you could start a rumor about yourself, what would it be?</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>I don't know if this is OK, but I think it's really funny when really random celebrities have a military past. And I think the rumor I would start is I was in the Coast Guard for like 10 years and then hard pivoted to comedy. Just that I'm like, super ripped underneath all of my clothes</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@allybeardsley href=#>@allybeardsley</a><p>ðŸŒ±ðŸ‘œ</p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Ally Beardsley" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Ally Beardsley</a></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Where do you look for inspiration when creating a new character?</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>I usually start with something kind of like, vulnerable or like feminine. And I think that comes from my experience as being trans and like the parts of life that don't like fully translate to like in my transition, or like things from like, my feminine upbringing that I still hold on to or think are important and usually that feels like very fun to start with. So I'll just be like, 'Oh, this CEO woman gets everything done on time.' 'Oh, I really want to play like, a business suit wearing superhero that doesn't actually fight.' Like my brain will start churning, but it's usually with kind of like feminine archetypes that maybe I haven't seen portrayed before.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Is there a D&D class you haven't played yet that you really want to?</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>Right now I'm really obsessed with druids, and I would love to play some kind of like circle of spores druid or something like that. There's something about like, fermentation and the death-to-life lifecycle of fermentation and like rotting that could be so crazy as a character so that's kind of what I'm chewing on right now.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Do you have any superstitions about your dice? If so, please share.</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>Oh, boy, do I. We usually roll before we start each episode, and we just try to see who's rolling spicy. So even if it rolls a nat one, I keep it because that's a spicy roll if it's gonna roll a one it might roll a 20. And so I kind of get rid of all the eights and the twelves out of there, and then I limit it to the spicy dice.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Cait May for Dropout</span></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Who is your favorite NPC in 'Fantasy High'?</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>It's so hard to choose. Fantasy High has some of my favorite NPCs. I mean, obviously, Gilear. But I really really like Bud, the extremely politically engaged dad. I love Aelwyn. Aelwyn is such a good sister character that's like kind of mean. Those are my top three.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">If you had to return to 'Fantasy High' as a character other than the Bad Kids, who would you play?</h2><p><strong>AB: </strong>I would love to play the banker, like someone who's working for like Nemesis Alert. I think that's really funny. Like a middle management person who has to deal with like Fabian trying to kill them at all times. That would be very funny.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What is your No. 1 distraction?</h2><p><strong>AB:</strong><strong> </strong>Hearthstone. The deck builder game that nobody plays anymore. Everyone went to Magic the Gathering Arena, which I deeply respect, but I have spent so much time in Hearthstone that I can't imagine leaving.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0wNGamq2dlGLEqsDHZpilpKlir6at0Z2qpZ2p</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdistracted-with-ally-beardsley.html&text=Distracted%20With...%20Ally%20Beardsley%20%28EXCLUSIVE%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdistracted-with-ally-beardsley.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdistracted-with-ally-beardsley.html&title=Distracted%20With...%20Ally%20Beardsley%20%28EXCLUSIVE%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdistracted-with-ally-beardsley.html&title=Distracted%20With...%20Ally%20Beardsley%20%28EXCLUSIVE%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdistracted-with-ally-beardsley.html&title=Distracted%20With...%20Ally%20Beardsley%20%28EXCLUSIVE%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdistracted-with-ally-beardsley.html&description=Distracted%20With...%20Ally%20Beardsley%20%28EXCLUSIVE%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michael-strahan-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Strahan - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./417562-auctioneers-raid-knut-head-offices-over-ksh-14m-debt-cart-away-all-office-equipment-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Auctioneers Raid KNUT Head Offices over KSh 1.4m Debt, Cart Away All Office Equipment">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
