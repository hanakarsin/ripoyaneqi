Scroll down for the latest details on Loughlin's case and what sort of time in the big house the Full House star received.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Loughlin and Giannulli took a plea deal, and they will spend time in prison.</h2><p>The 54-year-old initially faced up to 40 years in prison, however, according to CNN, Loughlin <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">will be spending two months in prison</a>, while Giannulli is facing five months. The mother-of-two and her fashion designer husband are guilty of paying $500,000 to get their daughters, Isabella Rose and <a href=#>Olivia Jade</a>, into the University of Southern California.&nbsp;</p><p>The scam's mastermind, William Singer, misrepresented the girls as crew team recruits in order to ensure their admittance.</p><p>Loughlin and Giannulli previously rejected a plea agreement because it apparently included jail time, but it was lowered tremendously.</p><p>"They decided to roll the dice and it may have been a bad gamble," a legal source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in April. "[The prosecutors] are saying that the only way anyone’s going to escape jail time is if they go to trial and are found not guilty. But [prosecutors also say] they have such meticulous evidence that it would be foolish to take that risk."</p><p>The former <a href=#>When Calls the Heart</a> star kept an incredibly low profile as she awaited trial. She posted a $1 million bail bond shortly after her arrest on March 13, 2019. Sources said Loughlin took the situation very seriously, but she was in total denial if she were to be convicted.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"Lori in particular has become extremely well-versed in the case," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an insider had told</a> People. "She’s an active participant in her own defense, feels like she’s got a valid defense, and that when all the evidence comes out, she won’t be found guilty."</p><p>At the time, the insider added, "<a href=#>She isn’t working</a>, and her whole life focus has changed drastically. It consists of waiting around for the next court date and planning her legal defense."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another source shared</a> that the New York native believes going to trial might actually help repair her reputation. "Lori feels like so much damage has been done publicly that the only way for her to counter it is to fight this case in court."</p><p>The source insisted that Loughlin and her husband never intended to do anything illegal. "When you look at it in context, you can argue that this is a woman who didn’t understand exactly what she was doing — and she was being counseled and guided by a man [William Singer] who this was his area of expertise."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Despite claims that Loughlin didn’t fully grasp what was happening, a series of incriminating emails show the actress’s eagerness to see her daughters accepted to USC despite their mediocre academic qualifications.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How long will Lori Loughlin be in jail?</h2><p>More than a year and a half after the findings from Operation Varsity Blues went public, Loughlin and Giannulli finally learned if their plea deal would be accepted.&nbsp;</p><p>In the morning hours of Aug. 21, Giannulli learned that he would be sentenced to five months in prison, 250 hours of community service, and that he would be ordered to pay a $250,000 fine. He will surrender to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons by 2 p.m. on Nov. 19.</p><p>During his virtual sentencing hearing, Giannulli apologized for his role in the admissions scandal.&nbsp;</p><p>"I deeply regret the harm that my actions have caused my daughters, my wife and others. I take full responsibility for my conduct," he said. "I'm ready to accept the consequences and move forward with the lessons I've learned from this experience."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>His wife was informed about the status of her deal just a few hours later. Her plea was also accepted, and she was sentenced to two months in prison.&nbsp;</p><p>She must pay a $150,000 fine, and she also has to complete 150 hours of community service. The terms of her deal were lighter because she played a less active role in the bribery.&nbsp;</p><p>At this time, it's unclear when Loughlin will have to report to prison.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither Olivia Jade nor Isabella Giannulli have publicly commented on their parents' prison sentences at this time.&nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, we never thought Aunt Becky would be spending time behind bars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecuopaBlp565rXnLqKmiZZykwqi0y6KlZpqVYravecmaoKU%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-long-will-lori-loughlin-be-in-jail.html&text=How%20Long%20Will%20Lori%20Loughlin%20Be%20in%20Jail%3f%20Her%20Guilty%20Plea%20Explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-long-will-lori-loughlin-be-in-jail.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-long-will-lori-loughlin-be-in-jail.html&title=How%20Long%20Will%20Lori%20Loughlin%20Be%20in%20Jail%3f%20Her%20Guilty%20Plea%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-long-will-lori-loughlin-be-in-jail.html&title=How%20Long%20Will%20Lori%20Loughlin%20Be%20in%20Jail%3f%20Her%20Guilty%20Plea%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-long-will-lori-loughlin-be-in-jail.html&title=How%20Long%20Will%20Lori%20Loughlin%20Be%20in%20Jail%3f%20Her%20Guilty%20Plea%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-long-will-lori-loughlin-be-in-jail.html&description=How%20Long%20Will%20Lori%20Loughlin%20Be%20in%20Jail%3f%20Her%20Guilty%20Plea%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./peace-accord.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Read All The Latest News About Peace Accord On Naija News">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cashier-sentenced-for-stealing-n9m-from-popular-bank.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cashier Sentenced For Stealing N9m From Popular Bank">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
