The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Edinburgh Fringe Festival</a> is the world’s largest arts festival and was established in 1947 as an alternative to the Edinburgh International Festival in order to feature more indie and out-of-the-box performers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One of the only festivals that accepts every admission, the Edinburgh Fringe has been a launching-off point for many celebrities, such as <a href=#>Alan Rickman</a> and <a href=#>Robin Williams</a>, who might not have made it big otherwise. Because of the festival’s accessibility, major reviewers from all over the world have the opportunity to bring lesser known performers into the spotlight. So who are some celebs that were actually discovered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Any up-and-coming female comedian or performer is familiar with the story of <a href=#>Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s</a> Fleabag. While she had bit acting roles in the UK and in film beforehand, her one-woman show, <a href=#>Fleabag</a>, which was first performed in its entirety at the 2013 <a href=#>Edinburgh Film Festival</a>, is what brought Phoebe true acclaim. The Emmy winner is now a household name thanks to the Fringe.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, and Tony Slattery</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>All of these film and television stars are celebs in their own right, but their careers were launched by a collaborative performance at the 1981 Edinburgh Fringe. The four now-famous actors starred in a production of Footlights, which won the Fringe’s very first Perrier Award. <a href=#>Emma Thompson</a> is the only person to have won an Oscar for both writing and acting, while Fry and Laurie are considered the apex of comedy duos.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Robin Williams</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>One of the most beloved comedians of all time, <a href=#>Robin Williams</a> actually got his big break thanks to the 1971 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. He played Tranio in his student theater company’s production of Taming of the Shrew, which won the Fringe’s Best Production award.
