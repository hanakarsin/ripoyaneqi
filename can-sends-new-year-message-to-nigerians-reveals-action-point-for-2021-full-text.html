Dr. Samson Olasupo A. Ayokunle</strong> on Thursday noted that despite the many challenges of 2020, 2021 is set to be a better year.</p><p>Quoting the bible in Psalm 91, Ayokunle explained that dwelling in the ‘Secret Place of the most high’ to overcome all challenges of this year means living according to God’s instructions.</p><p>He urged political leaders to rise up to their responsibility and tackle the economic, security, and other challenges facing Nigerians.</p><p>The CAN President added further that dwelling in the secret place of the most high doesn’t imply throwing reason away or disobeying laid down rules and regulations but it enables God’s mercy to prevail over all situations.</p><p>On that note, Revd Ayokunle urged Nigerians to continue to stay safe by observing all the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>COVID-19</a></strong> protocols put forward by the government and health experts such as maintaining social distancing, regular hand washing and use of hand sanitizer.</p><p>Below is the full text of the message made available to <strong>Naija News</strong>.</p><p>“I congratulate everyone of us whom God has spared to see this New Year in the midst of the dreadful and devastating coronavirus that ravaged our world and sent many people to early graves more than any war in the recent past.</p><p>The high and the low really fell in 2020. While we again commiserate with those who lost their loved ones and pray for fortitude for them to bear the loss, it is right for the rest of us to say, ‘to God alone be the glory.’ My prayer is that, the God of mercy who showed us mercy in 2020 shall continue to show us mercy in this New Year in Jesus’ name.</p><p>I may not know the challenges that you may be in this year but I know that the best way to overcome the challenges of this year without losing anything is to dwell in the ‘Secret Place of the Most High.’</p><p>This would cause us to abide under the shadow of the Almighty always according to Psalm 91, beginning from verse one. The whole Psalm is appropriate as our watchword to overcome all challenges of the year.</p><p>I was reading in the newspaper the statement of Bill Gates who said that he could not explain why COVID-19 mortality was low in Africa generally where healthcare was poorer than the Developed World.</p><p>The right answer is that dwelling in the secret place of the Most High saved Africa. We are technologically poor but we believe we have a big and great God whom we can trust, whom we can run to His secret place and abide under His shadow.</p><p>The mercy of God made the difference in Africa, especially Nigeria where health experts predicted that 30 million people would die.</p><p>I am not saying that the advanced nations of the world do not believe in God but that our own lack of human strength, lack of health infrastructure (though not our pride), have made us to trust in God more than human science and technology. The mercy of God has preserved us and will continue to preserve us all the days of our lives in the name of Jesus Christ.</p><p>The secret place of the Most High is like the VIP lounge where important people stay in the airport. It is different from the common lounge where other travellers stay. It is equipped with better chairs for maximum comfort and with other services making waiting at the airport more comfortable.</p><p>Dwelling in the ‘Secret Place of the Most High’ to overcome all challenges of this year means, to constantly love God by becoming closer to him in daily communion. To cultivate a lifestyle of fervent prayers for all things before taking any decision or doing anything. It is to study the Word of God daily, to constantly be in the fellowship of God’s people and forsaking all bad gangs or terrorist groups. It is to run away from the life of sin and abide by faith on daily basis for daily victory.</p><p>Dwelling in the secret place of the Most High requires that we trust in the Lord with our whole heart without seeking lesser gods. If we do these, all the promises of protection, provision, elevation, long life and every other good thing would be our portion in the name of Jesus Christ.</p><p>I plead with all of us to please observe all the COVID-19 protocols this year. Maintain social distancing, do hand washing or use sanitizer. Make sure you always wear your face mask whenever you are out from your house until we all together, under God, wipe away this wicked virus from the face of the earth. Avoid frivolous traveling meanwhile and use virtual meetings where possible for your safety.</p><p>I urge all those in political power in our nation to lead with humility by listening to Godly admonition because their wisdom alone may not be enough to reposition our nation, especially, to restore our security and bring about peace and prosperity presently eluding our nation. The present spate of kidnappings for ransom or death, terrorism, banditry, herdsmen attack, armed robbery and other anti-social activities in our nation are dents on the leadership of our nation.</p><p>Though, we understand that leadership is tough and sympathize with those in power, Nigerians at the same time expect that leadership would rise more gallantly to address our near horrible socio-economic situation in this nation which is almost crippling us. Let us love one another and put an end to cruelty against one another under any guise. Nigerians deserve to have their rest of mind.</p><p>On behalf of Christian Association of Nigeria, I wish everyone in this nation a Happy, Prosperous and COVID-19 free New Year 2021 in Jesus’ name.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Lagos State Command of the Nigeria Police Force has asked all its officers to ensure compliance on all COVID-19 protocols issued made available by the government and the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19.</p><p>The security operatives were <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>in a statement</a></strong> made available by the State Commissioner of Police, <strong>Hakeem Odumosu</strong>, on Thursday, December 31 directed to enforce the 12 am to 4 am curfew and also ensure the total closure of night clubs, bars, lounges, event centres, amongst others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5JqZpyZnmLAprrDrGSnnadixqat0WaknqujlrSmedOoZKehl5q%2Fqq3NrGSrnaaarq2%2FjJqaraGfo3qxu8inq2aen6d6c3yRamSfrZyherWx161m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcan-sends-new-year-message-to-nigerians-reveals-action-point-for-2021-full-text.html&text=CAN%20Sends%20New%20Year%20Message%20To%20Nigerians%2c%20Reveals%20Action%20Point%20For%202021%20%28Full%20Text%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcan-sends-new-year-message-to-nigerians-reveals-action-point-for-2021-full-text.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcan-sends-new-year-message-to-nigerians-reveals-action-point-for-2021-full-text.html&title=CAN%20Sends%20New%20Year%20Message%20To%20Nigerians%2c%20Reveals%20Action%20Point%20For%202021%20%28Full%20Text%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcan-sends-new-year-message-to-nigerians-reveals-action-point-for-2021-full-text.html&title=CAN%20Sends%20New%20Year%20Message%20To%20Nigerians%2c%20Reveals%20Action%20Point%20For%202021%20%28Full%20Text%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcan-sends-new-year-message-to-nigerians-reveals-action-point-for-2021-full-text.html&title=CAN%20Sends%20New%20Year%20Message%20To%20Nigerians%2c%20Reveals%20Action%20Point%20For%202021%20%28Full%20Text%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcan-sends-new-year-message-to-nigerians-reveals-action-point-for-2021-full-text.html&description=CAN%20Sends%20New%20Year%20Message%20To%20Nigerians%2c%20Reveals%20Action%20Point%20For%202021%20%28Full%20Text%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./toby-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Famous Tobys | Famous Birthdays">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alexia-putellas-wins-womens-ballon-dor-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexia Putellas Wins Women's Ballon dOr 2021">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
