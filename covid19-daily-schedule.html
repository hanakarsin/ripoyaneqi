This is super weird, right? Life has really changed abruptly and dramatically in the past couple weeks, as the U.S. tries to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. All adults who can work from home are being asked to do so in entire cities and states where COVID-19 cases are especially high. And with school closures, we're all suddenly spending a lot of time under one roof with our families.</p><p>A schedule is essential to keep the household on track, but what a daunting task on top of everything else we're dealing with! Look, you have a lot on your plate now, so rather than totally reinventing the wheel, why not browse through the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 daily schedules</a> all those annoyingly organized parents have already put together. You can copy them for rote or custom-fit them to meet your family's individual needs!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Having a COVID-19 schedule helps you maintain balance</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Made this schedule to keep myself and my family sane through the unprecedented weeks ahead. Funny how everything works - it’s gotten picked up by behavior groups, doctors, teachers, and has been shared more than 10k (edit: 52k!) times that I know of. I feel like I just got an official mom trophy 😂 . Posting here because maybe it will help some of my family clients, too. I made it based off my kids ages and our family, use as-is or as a jumping off point for your own. Whatever we can do to help each other through whatever is coming! . I’d love to hear what you are doing for your kids? How are you planning to manage the inevitable difficulties that come with two weeks away from activities and friends? .

I know by the end of the day I’m feeling pretty irritated and ready for some alone time (and it’s been like two days?!) So... I’ve made a family schedule to keep us sane and productive. Fingers crossed 🤞 I can get some of my work done at the same time as the kids are doing their academic work. I was not ready to be a stay at home mom or a home school teacher, but I’m gonna try to do my best with the circumstances we find ourselves in. Here is my first draft at a balanced schedule.
