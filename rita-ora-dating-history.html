Currently, Rita is working on her third album. Much of Rita's career trajectory is familiar to the public, but what about her love life?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On Aug. 9, 2022, the "Grateful" songstress reportedly wed long-term partner and director Taika Waititi. What is her dating history before her relationship with Taika? Here's what you need to know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rob Kardashian (2012)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to People Magazine, Rob and Rita dated briefly in 2012. Although their relationship only lasted a few months, Rita told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sunday Times</a> in 2020, "Oh, I forgot about that. It was very short-lived. I was so young. It was great. It was fun. It was very, very fun, I guess. That's all I remember."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Calvin Harris (2013–2014)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>For a little over a year, Rita dated DJ and songwriter Calvin Harris. During their relationship, the couple co-wrote the song "I Will Never Let You Down," but after their relationship had ended, the song's rights caused tension between them. Rita reportedly dropped out of the 2014 Teen Choice Awards because Calvin refused to let her perform the song.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a> reported that Calvin had denied his permission for "all televised performances and sync licenses of the track," and he defensively tweeted later that he had a "damn good reason" for nixing the performance. Tabloids suggested the duo had a falling out over cheating rumors with Justin Bieber, but the rumors have never been confirmed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Rita explained to Billboard, "I don’t control other people’s minds, especially if they’ve written a great song. I couldn’t care less that I couldn’t perform it — it was about my fans being disappointed, and that’s my nightmare. But I performed it [at the Made in America festival] and I’m sure I’ll perform it three years from now. It’s a part of me. I’m not going to deny that."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Andrew Watt (2016–2018)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Rita and American musician Andrew Watt were in an on-and-off relationship from 2016 to 2018.

Currently, Andrew is responsible for producing Eddie Vedder's solo album and Britney Spears' upcoming single "Hold Me Closer."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The pair were together two full years until they broke up in September 2018, then reconciled in January 2019, and ultimately broke up for good in October of the same year.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Andrew Garfield (2019)</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Magazine</a>, Andrew and Rita were linked on and off between November 2018 and March 2019. A source who spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mirror</a> about their relationship said at the time, "The relationship just fizzled out. It's sad, but they have both accepted the situation and moved on."

In February 2021, Romain spoke about their relationship, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, "Rita and I are very close. She is an amazing person." However, it appears Romain did not mean "close" in a romantic sense and later confirmed the pair had split due to work commitments.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Taika Waititi (2021–present)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Taika and Rita first sparked romance rumors when she posted a photo of him to her Instagram in April 2021. The pair had previously been spotted out at a rooftop bar in July of the same year.

Rita has also reportedly changed her name to Mrs. Rita Waititi-Ora.</p><p>Congratulations to the happy couple!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Rita Ora's ethnicity?</h2><p>According to a 2015 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Claire</a> interview, Rita discussed her heritage and her parents. Rita was born in what is formerly Yugoslavia but is currently Kosovo to Albanian parents. The etymology of Rita's name is Turkish, but her parents later added "Ora" to her surname so it could be more easily pronounced.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Rita's family fled to London following the persecution of Albanians during the breakup of Yugoslavia. In 2020, she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accused of blackfishing</a> after a photo of Rita with her white parents surfaced on the internet.</p><p>The songstress confirmed her ethnicity in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Wendy Williams</a> in 2016, where Wendy said, "I thought you were half-Black and half-white, or something like that." Rita replied, "Everybody usually does. I might as well be.
