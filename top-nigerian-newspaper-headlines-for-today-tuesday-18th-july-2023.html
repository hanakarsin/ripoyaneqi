In contrast, such a signal would typically be signed by an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) who heads such formations.</p><p>The force, via its Twitter account, said the Acting Inspector-General of Police, IGP Kayode Adeolu Egbetokun, has ordered a thorough investigation into the source of the fake memo.</p><p>The Deputy National Chairman (North) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abubakar Kyari, has emerged as the new acting national chairman of the party.</p><p>Naija News reports that this development follows the sudden resignation of the embattled former national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu.</p><p>Recall that Nigerians woke up to reports of Adamu’s resignation, confirmed by Kyari himself.</p><p>The new APC acting national chairman told pressmen after National Working Committee (NWC) meeting in Abuja on Monday that he was Adamu’s successor and by the law of the party, the Deputy National Secretary, Festus Fuanter, will serve as the acting National Secretary of the APC.</p><p>He also confirmed the resignation of the party’s National Secretary, Iyiola Omisore.</p><p>The Labour Party (LP) has told President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to stop threatening the judiciary, insisting that his removal from office by the court will not cause anarchy in the country.</p><p>Naija News recalls that Tinubu had warned about the potential consequences of nullifying the election that produced him as the president.</p><p>He cautioned that such a decision, based on his failure to secure 25% of the lawful votes in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), could result in absurdity, chaos, anarchy, and the distortion of the legislature’s original intent.</p><p>The president stated this while presenting his final written address to the Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPEC) on the petitions filed by candidates from the LP, Peter Obi, and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar challenging the validity of his victory.</p><p>In a statement on Monday by its national publicity secretary, Obiora Ifoh, the Labour Party warned that Tinubu and the All Progressives Congress (APC) must be cautious in their approach to the matter, which is still in court.</p><p>The party said no amount of pressure on the judges in the tribunal could change the processes and requirements that the law has put in place.</p><p>A former presidential candidate of the Action Democratic Congress (ADC), Dumebi Kachikwu says President Bola Tinubu has taken some wrong policy steps since assuming power on May 29, 2023.</p><p>Speaking in an interview with Arise TV on Monday morning, Kachikwu said an analysis of the President’s actions is like taking two steps forward and taking another ten steps backward.</p><p>The former Presidential candidate however put a large blame for what is happening on the doorsteps of President Tinubu’s advisers saying they are advising him wrongly.</p><p>Speaking further, Kachikwu said Tinubu should have appointed his Ministers to assist him in governance by now but seems rather distracted with receiving friends, family, and well-wishers.</p><p>According to him, President Tinubu is in a “‘na me be this’ phase,” where he is thrilled with his becoming the president after a long time.</p><p>The Bola Ahmed Tinubu-led Federal Government on Monday confirmed the first case of anthrax in the country.</p><p>Naija News understands that Anthrax is a severe bacterial disease that affects humans and animals, including wild animals and livestock such as cows, pigs, camels, sheep, goats.</p><p>In a move to prevent the sread, the government outlined preventive measures for Nigerians and livestock owners to reduce the potential risk of infection and the spread of anthrax.</p><p>In a statement by the Chief Veterinary Officer of Nigeria, Dr. Columba T. Vakuru, the first case of Anthrax occurred on a farm in Suleja, Niger State.</p><p>He disclosed that a Rapid Response team comprising federal and state Health Professional Team have visited the farm to conduct preliminary investigations and collected samples from the sick animals.</p><p>Vakuru explained that animals showing signs of a possible case of anthrax on a farm in Suleja, Niger State, were reported to the Office of the Chief Veterinary Officer of Nigeria on July 14, 2023.</p><p>The People Democratic Party (PDP) has voiced concerns over what it perceives as an attempt by President Bola Tinubu’s legal team to influence the judiciary.</p><p>The claim was made in response to the legal team’s written address to the Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC).</p><p>The National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, made the claim in a statement in Abuja on Monday.</p><p>He described the contents of the address by the legal team, which represents the All Progressives Congress and the President, as a calculated effort to unsettle the judiciary.</p><p>The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday disclosed that Nigeria’s inflation rate accelerated for the sixth consecutive time to 22.79 per cent in June 2023.</p><p>Naija News reports that the inflation rate rose to a new 17-year high of 22.79 per cent in June 2023 from 22.41 per cent in the previous month.</p><p>The NBS report read, “In June 2023, the Headline inflation rate rose to 22.79 per cent relative to May 2023 headline inflation rate, which was 22.41 per cent. Looking at the movement, the June 2023 Headline inflation rate showed an increase of 0.38 percentage points when compared to May 2023 headline inflation rate.</p><p>On a year-on-year basis, the Headline inflation rate was 4.19 percentage points higher compared to the rate recorded in June 2022, which was 18.60 per cent. This shows that the Headline inflation rate (year-on-year basis) increased in June 2023 when compared to the same month in the preceding year (i.e., June 2022).”</p><p>Food and non-alcoholic beverages (11.81 per cent) led the list of items that contributed to the rising inflation figure.</p><p>The new Acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abubakar Kyari has said there is no corruption allegation against the immediate past chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu.</p><p>Naija News reports that Kyari also stated that the erstwhile National Secretary of the party, Senator Iyiola Omisore, is not facing any corrupt allegation.</p><p>He started these while addressing journalists shortly after the crucial meeting of the National Working Committee held at the party secretariat on Monday.</p><p>Kyari also dismissed speculation that the party may send operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) after both Adamu and Omisore.</p><p>When quizzed on what led to their resignation, the acting chairman declined to give further information, saying the development will be disclosed at a future date.</p><p>Kyari promised that the new APC leadership will address the plethora of issues raised by the National Vice Chairman for North-West, Salihu Lukman.</p><p>An Ad-hoc Committee set up by the 10th House of Representatives on Monday screened the recently nominated Service Chiefs by President Bola Tinubu.</p><p>Naija News reports that the Screening Committee is led by the Majority Leader of the House, Hon. Julius Ihonvbere (APC- Edo State).</p><p>The nominated Service Chiefs are Major General C.G Musa as Chief of Defence Staff; Major General T. A. Lagbaja as Chief of Army Staff; Rear Admiral E. A. Ogalla as Chief of Naval Staff; and Air Vice Marshal H.B. Abubakar as Chief of Air Staff.</p><p>The House Speaker, Tajudeen Abbas, had declared the formation of the Ad-hoc Committee, stating that it would consist of the eight principal officers of the House from both the majority and minority parties.</p><h2>Those are the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
