I am sad to say that what ensued at the venue of the primaries highly threatens the credibility and integrity the APC has built over two political cycles. It is therefore a great disservice to my people and our great party, to be silent about such injustice.</p><p>“To the best of my knowledge, election at the primaries stage requires delegates to cast their votes and a winner emerges with the majority votes. It, therefore, implies that there could not have been any voting process that occurred considering majority of the delegates were neither allowed to vote nor even granted access to the venue.</p><p>“No document that supposedly validates the election was signed by my agents because they were also denied access to the voting area.</p><p>“On my arrival to the venue as an aspirant too, I was denied access to the voting area. My supporters who were around the premises for the primaries resisted the unjust treatment I was given and attempted insisting on my entrance into the voting area.</p><p>“Like I have consistently been saying, my ambition is not worth anybody’s life or safety, so at that time, I believed the best action to take was to vacate the premises in order to douse the friction and for the safety of the majority delegates, my agents and my supporters who were being targeted by thugs.</p><p>“I, therefore call on the stakeholders of our party, the APC, to as a matter of urgency, save the reputation of the party by insisting on the members of the electoral committee to conduct a fresh, free and fair election.</p><p>“I would like to commend and extend profound gratitude to the delegates who despite the ill-treatment, refused to be intimidated by anyone. I would also like to send my appreciation to my supporters who have always been with me from the onset. To be silent about the injustice we have experienced, is to disappoint those supporters. I implore all to be calm and remain the law-abiding citizens I know you to be because I still have faith in the APC that this spectacular blunder, we have experienced on the 27th of May, 2022 shall be annulled and credible primary election shall be conducted.</p><p>“Thank you very much and may Allah bless you all.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FxZputmJa%2Fqr%2BMnq9mmZmZsm6uwKyfoqpdlrWurcNmpJqjlah6p77ErJ9mnJWirq%2BwjJqdrZ2iYrWmrdWyZJ2dlpqutXnArWSaqJNivbO1zJqpop2jZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbuharis-ex-aide-bashir-ahmad-makes-fresh-demand-after-heavy-defeat-at-apc-primaries.html&text=Buhari%27s%20Ex-aide%2c%20Bashir%20Ahmad%20Makes%20Fresh%20Demand%20After%20Heavy%20Defeat%20At%20APC%20Primaries&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbuharis-ex-aide-bashir-ahmad-makes-fresh-demand-after-heavy-defeat-at-apc-primaries.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbuharis-ex-aide-bashir-ahmad-makes-fresh-demand-after-heavy-defeat-at-apc-primaries.html&title=Buhari%27s%20Ex-aide%2c%20Bashir%20Ahmad%20Makes%20Fresh%20Demand%20After%20Heavy%20Defeat%20At%20APC%20Primaries" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbuharis-ex-aide-bashir-ahmad-makes-fresh-demand-after-heavy-defeat-at-apc-primaries.html&title=Buhari%27s%20Ex-aide%2c%20Bashir%20Ahmad%20Makes%20Fresh%20Demand%20After%20Heavy%20Defeat%20At%20APC%20Primaries" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbuharis-ex-aide-bashir-ahmad-makes-fresh-demand-after-heavy-defeat-at-apc-primaries.html&title=Buhari%27s%20Ex-aide%2c%20Bashir%20Ahmad%20Makes%20Fresh%20Demand%20After%20Heavy%20Defeat%20At%20APC%20Primaries" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbuharis-ex-aide-bashir-ahmad-makes-fresh-demand-after-heavy-defeat-at-apc-primaries.html&description=Buhari%27s%20Ex-aide%2c%20Bashir%20Ahmad%20Makes%20Fresh%20Demand%20After%20Heavy%20Defeat%20At%20APC%20Primaries" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./erica-dixon-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erica Dixon - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./2023-witches-warn-osinbajo-against-contesting-for-presidency.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Witches Warn Osinbajo Against Contesting For Presidency">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
