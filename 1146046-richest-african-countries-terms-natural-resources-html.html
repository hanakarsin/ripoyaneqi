In fact, Africa is a home to the major amount of mineral deposits of the world, and this makes room for more natural resource industries in the world, located in Africa. While the continent may not be as rich in other things, it is clearly extremely fertile and wealthy in terms of natural mineral resources.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f84ef6936e757d60.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Importance of mineral resources in Nigeria you should know about</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tracing back in history, it is quite obvious that the colonial conflicts between Africa and the West were caused by the natural wealth of Africa’s soil. Nowadays, the governments of those countries which are rich in minerals need to learn how to put them to proper use and boost the economic development of their countries through exports.</p><p class=align-left>In particular, African countries are the leaders in such minerals as diamonds, platinum, zirconium, cobalt, bauxite, and others. The mining of these natural resources has significantly decreased in the latest years, but this does not deny the fact that African mineral potential is really rich and can be used for the best economical purposes by the governments.</p><p class=align-left>Here, you can see ten countries which are especially wealthy in their natural resources. All of them have a big supply of valuable minerals, and they can potentially export them all over the world. If you want to know which country is the richest in Africa in the certain mineral extraction and export, you can go through this list below.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b9b9d67deb4a35b8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What are the 10 major political problems in Nigeria today?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f84ef6936e757d60.jpg><h3>1. Niger – rich in uranium, coal, cement, and gold</h3><p class=align-left>This country has been a home to the largest underground mine in the world, where one can extract uranium. Lately, Niger has received a lot of benefits from selling their raw minerals on the world’s market, even though uranium still brings them the biggest income. Niger supplies 44% of African uranium all over the world, and this makes the country one of the richest in this mineral.</p><p class=align-left>40% of all Niger’s exports are from uranium trade, which helps increase the national economy. Being a naturally radioactive mineral, uranium is useful in producing a nuclear weapon. This is why Korea and China mostly benefit from Niger’s natural resources and trade with them. Apart from this material, Niger also has many other useful ones in stock, like coal, gold, and cement. The whole mineral potential of Niger has really attracted a lot of buyers to the country where they can export their resources.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/63e5f0805c73c957.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dirtiest city in Africa: 20 most polluted cities in Africa</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b9b9d67deb4a35b8.jpg><h3>2. Namibia – rich in uranium, diamonds, zinc, lead, sulphur, salt, tantalite, and copper</h3><p class=align-left>Here is another country which is a productive uranium supplier. In fact, it proudly holds the fourth place in the world at uranium. China’s biggest investment on the African continent is their mining company in Namibia, which specializes in uranium. It is estimated that 15 million pounds of uranium oxide can be produced out of Namibian resources. International companies are invested in the country’s uranium resources for the production of energy. Uranium was first discovered in the desert Namibia, and its exploration began in 1960.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytie3fepl2vv4.jpg><h3>3. Democratic Republic of Congo – rich in copper, cobalt, diamond, oil, coltan, gold, and tin</h3><p class=align-left>DRC has one of the richest deposits of mineral resources. Since 1960, DRC has been known for its mineralization as one of the most industrialized countries in Africa.</p><p class=align-left>In 2010, the government made a decision to suspend the mining of minerals because they had to investigate the legality of the treasure theft. In 2011, about twenty foreign mining enterprises were functioning in the country. DRC is endowed with oil, copper, coltan, cobalt, gold, diamonds, and other natural minerals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7af040el96d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 richest countries in Africa: what is Nigeria's ranking?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/63e5f0805c73c957.png><h3>4. Zambia – rich in copper, emerald, and cobalt</h3><p class=align-left>If you wanted to know what the richest African country in copper is, it is, beyond dispute, Zambia. It is known for being a number one copper producer and supplier – it produces 77% of African copper. Zambia is also a place where Copperbelt, the mass copper production region, is situated. Also, this country has the biggest underground mine on the whole continent, which has 10,000 workers. Generally, this mine produces about 300,000 tons of copper annually. There are other minerals in Zambia, the production of which is smaller than copper, but still quite pmpressive. These are emerald and cobalt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6fr99j2kqe.jpg><h3>5. South Africa – rich in diamonds and gold</h3><p class=align-left>The whole world is aware that South Africa’s economy has risen in the past couple of decades because of its rich mineral industry, especially the natural resources of precious minerals.</p><p class=align-left>There are large amounts of diamonds and gold deposited in South Africa, and they have really contributed to the nation’s development. According to the historical facts, the Anglo-Boer war broke out because people have discovered huge deposits of gold in Witwatersrand.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt64dp4k2p4jb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 poorest countries in Africa</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The mineral industry annually adds 20% to GDP of South Africa, and the income per year is approximately 550 billion rand. Apart from gold and diamonds, which South Africa is so popular for, there is a plenty of other minerals like platinum, copper, uranium, vanadium, coal, chromium, iron, zirconium, nickel, and many others. South Africa is surely a wealthy country in mineral resources, which the nation owes its development to.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Top 10 most industrialized states in Nigeria</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt14q5htgdmd1o.jpg><h3>6. Mozambique – rich in aluminum</h3><p class=align-left>Mozambique is a diverse country when it comes to natural resources because it has got a lot of them. But the most common natural mineral in this country is, without doubt, aluminum. The annual production of it is approximately 580,000 tons, which is a huge number. Consequently, it forms 30% of the country’s exports. Aside aluminum, Mozambique also exports beryllium and tantalum all over the world. Mozambican soil is rich in limestone, cement, marbles, gemstones, coals, iron, gold, oil, gas, and steel. All of these minerals have made the economy of the country more stable and their production has become really active in the past years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4k1pmljlabr.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 richest countries in Africa and interesting facts about them</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7af040el96d.jpg><h3>7. Guinea – rich in bauxite</h3><p class=align-left>The important part of Guinea natural potential is bauxite, which the country clearly holds leadership in. Actually, the production of bauxite really contributes to the production of aluminum: bauxite is an important ingredient of aluminum. Guinea is a clear leader in bauxite potential and export, producing 95% of the entire bauxite production of Africa. The country is followed by Mozambique and Ghana respectively. Except for Guinea, which produces the natural ingredient for aluminum, all the other countries use the synthetically made product.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3296flq0u62.jpg><h3>8. Tanzania – rich in tanzanite, gold, diamonds, and silver</h3><p class=align-left>As the name of the country implies, Tanzania is the only supplier in the world of the rare gemstone called tanzanite. Except for that, the country also produces gold – it is the fourth richest country in Africa in terms of gold.</p><p class=align-left>Throughout the decades, the gold mining industry of Tanzania fluctuated. This was happening until the 90s when some famous foreign companies decided to invest in the Tanzanian treasures. Nowadays, they have the standard mines multiplied, to enhance investment and development of their resources. While agriculture is a large contribution to the economy of the country, the gold and tanzanite trade does, too. Mineral exports really help and boost the Tanzanian economic conditions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2orp2ensj1i.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How import of maize in Nigeria has influenced profitability of its production</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2gt79qalh05g.jpg><h3>9.
