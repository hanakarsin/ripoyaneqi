She details her current predicament on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Only one Dollar General employee showed up to work, and apparently this isn't the first time this has happened.</h2><p>A Dollar General employee and TikToker named Dani (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@danisodope</a>) took to the platform to explain her situation: "Tell me why I'm the only one who showed up today. The only one. I'm not supposed to be in here by myself," she says in her video that's been viewed over a million times.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Dani reasons: "If my cashier is not here in 10 minutes, I'm closing up the store."</p><p>While some might be quick to judge her for giving up so easily as seemingly there must be a logical explanation for this (spoiler alert: there isn't!), Dani explains that this has happened before. And it was not a pleasant experience.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@danisodope href=#>@danisodope</a><p>And this is why working for other people is not for me.

Dani explains, recalling "I [was] the only one in here. I can't stalk the shelves, run the register, and manage the shift all by my f--king self."</p><p style=text-align:start>And while she noted that her store has self-checkout registers that could potentially lessen her load a little, she explains that many customers refuse to use them since she's paid to do that for them.</p><p style=text-align:start>But as Dani asserts in her video, "I barely get paid enough to show up."</p><p>In the comment section, users felt for Dani. One suggested that she should go home as it would be unsafe for her to be there alone. Dani agreed, writing "the location that I'm at definitely has a lot of theft, so I definitely don't feel comfortable being here by myself."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p style=text-align:start>Another user seconded the notion that Dani closes up shop, explaining that if she runs the store solo once, she'll likely get stuck doing it again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>And a third user claimed that she used to work at Dollar General and was forced to open and close the store by herself several times.</p><p>But that's not all that went wrong.
