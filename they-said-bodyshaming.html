For some reason, it seems as though everyone believes they have both a right and duty to comment on the appearance of any and all women and offer them guidance on what they should change about themselves in order to reach that ideal look in that specific nobody's eyes. It's a behavior that has been normalized in society and reinforced by edgy public figures who need to constantly find new ways to be edgy so they brush aside things like telling women to smile being a form of harassment and defaulting to traditional gender roles when they run out of arguments along with any number of references they can squeeze in from the good ol' days.</p><p>If there's one thing I learned in Kindergarten, it's that kids are merciless with their insults.</p><p>If the slightest thing is off about you - if you're wearing different clothing or you've got overly large glasses or have to use an inhaler, there will always be a group of kids there to make fun of you for it.</p><p>Good parents teach their kids out of making fun of others based on superficial things that may be out of their control, but unfortunately, some of those kids grow up to become adults who think it's OK to make fun of someone based on their looks. This is especially true of women's bodies. For example, a quick search on the Internet or look in the comments section of any Instagram post of a woman, and there'll be someone criticizing her body.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">So women started sharing their own body shaming stories online with the #TheySaid hashtag as a reminder that this gross phenomenon is sadly alive and well.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#TheySaid</a> is the best worst thing today.
